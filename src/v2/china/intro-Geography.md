    Coastline: 
    
    14,500 km
    
    Maritime claims: 
    
    territorial sea: 12 nm
    
    exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
    
    contiguous zone: 24 nm
    
    continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin
    
    Climate: 
    
    extremely diverse; tropical in south to subarctic in north
    
    Terrain: 
    
    mostly mountains, high plateaus, deserts in west; plains, deltas, and hills in east
    
    Elevation: 
    
    mean elevation: 1,840 m
    
    elevation extremes: \-154 m lowest point: Turpan Pendi
    
    8848 highest point: Mount Everest (highest peak in Asia and highest point on earth above sea level)
    
    Natural resources: 
    
    coal, iron ore, petroleum, natural gas, mercury, tin, tungsten, antimony, manganese, molybdenum, vanadium, magnetite, aluminum, lead, zinc, rare earth elements, uranium, hydropower potential (world's largest), arable land
    
    Land use: 
    
    agricultural land: 54.7% (2011 est.)
    
    arable land: 11.3% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 1.6% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 41.8% (2011 est.)
    
    forest: 22.3% (2011 est.)
    
    other: 23% (2011 est.)
    
    Irrigated land: 
    
    690,070 sq km (2012)
    
    Population distribution: 
    
    overwhelming majority of the population is found in the eastern half of the country; the west, with its vast mountainous and desert areas, remains sparsely populated; though ranked first in the world in total population, overall density is less than that of many other countries in Asia and Europe; high population density is found along the Yangtze and Yellow River valleys, the Xi Jiang River delta, the Sichuan Basin (around Chengdu), in and around Beijing, and the industrial area around Shenyang
    
    Natural hazards: 
    
    frequent typhoons (about five per year along southern and eastern coasts); damaging floods; tsunamis; earthquakes; droughts; land subsidence
    
    **volcanism:** China contains some historically active volcanoes including Changbaishan (also known as Baitoushan, Baegdu, or P'aektu-san), Hainan Dao, and Kunlun although most have been relatively inactive in recent centuries
    
    Environment - current issues: 
    
    air pollution (greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide particulates) from reliance on coal produces acid rain; China is the world's largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels; water shortages, particularly in the north; water pollution from untreated wastes; coastal destruction due to land reclamation, industrial development, and aquaculture; deforestation and habitat destruction; poor land management leads to soil erosion, landslides, floods, droughts, dust storms, and desertification; trade in endangered species
    
    Environment - international agreements: 
    
    party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling
    
    signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements
    
    Geography - note: 
    
    world's fourth largest country (after Russia, Canada, and US) and largest country situated entirely in Asia; Mount Everest on the border with Nepal is the world's tallest peak above sea level
